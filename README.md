# Project integrate library via node/npm/parcel.js

### What is this about?

- for desktop (not responsive), build a simple website with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, that includes a Spring animation off of the external library [popmotion](https://popmotion.io/)
- why JavaScript based animation? Quote: "the popmotion animations go beyond the capabilities of CSS (?), so use JavaScript"
- use node.js, npm, parcel.js
- [take and adapt code from previous tutorial](https://github.com/EllyPirelly/project-integrate-library)

### This Repo is based on:

- tutorial within [Frontendmasters' Beginners Path](https://frontendmasters.com/learn/beginner/)
- tutorial video [Building your code with node.js](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/web-development-v2/building-your-code-with-node-js/)
- tutorial course notes [Libraries](https://btholt.github.io/intro-to-web-dev-v2/libraries)

### Heads-up

- to quickly move on, I needed to pick another animation as the spring animation as shown in the tutorial is not working any longer
- [popmotion on codepen](https://codepen.io/popmotion)
- [popmotion code off of codepen I picked](https://codepen.io/popmotion/pen/vZwNap)

### How to run this?

- clone this repo
- `cd` into project
- `npm install`
- `parcel index.html` (if issues run `npx parcel build index.html` to at least have the files build)
- `parcel index.html` currently is not working for me regarding serving on localhost, I've opened the index.html via VSC's PlugIn "Live Server"

### At the moment, this project is not properly running and needs to be reviewed!
